# Inter-Mars
This is the work done for the Planetary Interiors module in University of Nantes.
Here we address the thermal structure and interior dynamics of Mars. In this practical, we calculate the temperature profile inside Mars’ crust and mantle due to the heat generated by radioactive decay, and assess the evolution of the planet’s cooling history.
